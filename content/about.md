Hi, and welcome. I'm Daniel Hanaj, IT consultant and author of this blog. 
Currently I work as as an Infrastructure Engineer focused on VMware Cloud Director and VMware stack. I love technology and automation. 

For most of my career I've been working with VMware products although recently I've changed my focus to DevOps, Automation and Cloud based solutions.

I believe that focusing on one technology may not be enough in today's IT world so looking some universal automation tools which will help me better utilize automation. 

I've decided to move out of my comfort zone and learn someting new. Technologies like HasihiCorp Terraform, Packer, Valut, Azure DevOps, Sesired State Configuration can and should be used in modern VMware environments. If you learn those technologies working with VMware stack , you can easily work with other cloud based solutions with some additional cloud trainings. 


And that what his blog will be about. VMware, DevOps, Automation and Cloud. 


If you still read this and you are in same position as I am join me reading this blog. I will use it mostly to memorize some things and learn new topics.

Happy reading!
