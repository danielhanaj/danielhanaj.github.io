#### Hi, and welcome. I'm Daniel Hanaj, author of this blog. 


Currently, I work as an Infrastructure Engineer focused on virtualization and private cloud computing. I love technology and automation.

For most of my career, I've been working with VMware products, although recently I've changed my focus to DevOps, automation, and cloud-based solutions.

I believe that focusing only on one technology may not be enough in today's IT world, so I'm looking for some universal tools that will help me better utilize automation.

I've decided to move out of my comfort zone and learn something new. Technologies like HashiCorp Terraform, Packer, Vault, Azure DevOps, Desired State Configuration, and Ansible can and should be used in modern virtualization environments. If you learn those technologies while working with your virtualization stack, you can easily work with other cloud-based solutions with some additional cloud training.

Personally, I love basketball and the NBA. Recently, I have realized that I like it not only because of the game itself (this part is also nice), but also because I appreciate how the NBA operates. There are many similarities between the NBA and the IT industry.

- It's a changing and evolving game (just like IT that continuously evolves),

- Each NBA player needs to continously improve (IT engineers need to improve their skills as well to stay attractive in the market),

- NBA organizations need to evolve to stay on top (IT organizations need to adopt new standards and solutions to improve their standards and quality of service),

- If there is no chance to build a successful NBA team that will be able to win the games, they usually decide to rebuild the entire organization, replacing the coach, players and GMs.  Even though I like this approach, many IT organizations are not willing to make such moves as it can bring significant operational risk. Personally, I think it's sometimes better to completely rebuild IT organizations, replacing management and unskilled people rather than staying inefficient. If you're not moving forward, you are stepping back.

Additionally, I love cooking, cycling, and watching snooker.

If you're still reading this and you are in the same position as I am, join me in reading this blog. I will use it mostly to memorize some things and learn new topics.

Happy reading!
