#### Hi, and welcome. I'm Daniel Hanaj, author of this blog. 


Currently, I work as as an Infrastructure Engineer focused on virtualization and private cloud computing. I love technology and automation. 


For most of my career, I've been working with VMware products, although recently I've changed my focus to DevOps, automation and cloud based solutions.


I believe that focusing only on one technology may not be enough in today's IT world, so I'm looking some universal tools which will help me better utilize automation. 


I've decided to move out of my comfort zone and learn something new. Technologies like HasihiCorp Terraform, Packer, Valut, Azure DevOps, Desired State Configuration, Ansible can and should be used in modern virtualization environments. If you learn those technologies working with your virtualization stack, you can easily work with other cloud based solutions with some additional cloud trainings. 


Personally, I love basketball and NBA. Recently I have realized that I like it not only because of the game itself (this part is also nice), although I realized that I liked how NBA works.  
There is much of similarities between NBA and IT industry. 

- It's a changing and evolving game (same as IT that continuously evolves),
- Each player needs to improve (IT engineers need to improve their skills as well to be attractive on the market), 
- Organizations needs to evolve to stay on the top (IT organizations need to adopt new standards and solutions to improve their standards and quality of service),
- In NBA, if there is no chance to build a successful team that will be able to win the games, they usually decide to rebuild the entire team, replacing the coach and players. Even I like this approach, many IT organizations not willing to make such moves as it can bring significant operation risk. Personally, I think it's sometimes better to completely rebuild IT organizations replacing management and unskilled people rather than stay inefficient.  
If you not moving forward, you are stepping back.

Additionally, I love cooking, cycling, ant watching snooker.


If you still read this, and you are in the same position as I am, join me reading this blog. I will use it mostly to memorize some things and learn new topics.

Happy reading!
